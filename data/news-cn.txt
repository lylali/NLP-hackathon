Los Angeles riots, is this a "civil war" of several United States?

Text/Observer Network columnist Yixian

In the early morning of June 6, several industrial parks and family communities in the suburbs of Los Angeles were simultaneously banged on doors and shouted. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched a rare multi-point raid, arresting dozens of immigrants who were "suspected of illegal residence or criminal records." As usual, the law enforcement video quickly appeared on social media, but this time, it ignited unexpected anger.

Within 48 hours, a large number of masked protesters gathered in Chinatown, Compton and 101 Freeway, confronted police officers, held high the Mexican flag, and threw Molotov cocktails. On one side, the National Guard entered the streets with live ammunition, and on the other side, the governor publicly condemned the federal government's "illegal overreach." The conflict quickly went beyond the immigration issue and evolved into a collective questioning of legitimacy, identity, and political boundaries.

The street riots burning with bullets and anger triggered an open confrontation about "who has the right to interpret order." The federal government, local governments, and immigrant groups are engaged in a burning collision on the cracks of the system over legitimate violence, belonging rights, and political sovereignty.

Federal and state: Who crossed the line?

Late at night on June 7, heavy footsteps sounded on the streets of Los Angeles, which had not yet subsided. The Trump administration announced that it would mobilize 2,000 California National Guard troops to directly enter multiple hotspots of demonstrations in Los Angeles on the grounds of "restoring order."

Unlike the usual procedures, this decision bypassed the consent of Governor Gavin Newsom and cut into local jurisdiction in an almost "military" way. Prior to this, California had clearly ordered not to cooperate with ICE's large-scale law enforcement, and this forced intervention undoubtedly pushed an immigration law enforcement storm to the forefront of the confrontation between the constitutional structure of the federal and state governments.

"This is an illegal political provocation." Newsom responded strongly, making it clear that the deployment was unauthorized and had not been communicated with the state government. He asked the Department of Defense to "immediately withdraw the order" and warned that the federal government was "deliberately creating a crisis." Los Angeles Mayor Beth also called it a "political show that overwhelms local authority", emphasizing that the local police are fully capable of dealing with the situation and that there is no need for federal force to intervene.

Trump's action is based on Section 12406 of Title 10 of the United States Code, which gives the president the power to directly call on the state National Guard when "open riots hinder the implementation of federal law", but usually must be negotiated with the state government.

This time, it is the first time since 1960 that a president has used the state guard to interfere in state affairs without the governor's permission. It marks a dangerous political signal: in the context of increasingly intensified political divisions, the understanding of "order", "justice" and "legitimacy" between the federal and local governments in the United States no longer shares the same map of constitutional language.

California has officially become a "sanctuary state" since 2017. According to SB 54, local law enforcement agencies are not allowed to assist federal arrests due to immigration status unless it involves serious violent crimes. In reality, the local government of California has long been in conflict with ICE. ICE frequently issues "wanted notices" accusing local police of releasing illegal immigrants and obstructing law enforcement. This action is a concentrated attempt to "correct" after years of stalemate.

But the question is not whether this law enforcement is "necessary", but whether it still has a "consensus on legitimacy".

When the federal government put state violence into the armored vehicles of the National Guard and rolled over the border line that the state government had publicly opposed - this is not only a breakdown of legal procedures, but also a collapse of political trust. It has shaken the constitutional stability of the United States and turned the system of "decentralization and cooperation" into the logic of power of "obey or suppress".

So we see that there are not only immigrant protesters on the streets, but also "civilians" without badges, masked people with unclear camps, and law students holding loudspeakers. They may not be clear about the tenth article of the constitutional amendment, but they clearly feel that law enforcement no longer represents rules, but has become an extension of a certain position.

Legitimate violence should be the boundary of maintaining public order; but when different power subjects have fundamental differences in their understanding of "legitimacy", the boundary of violence is no longer clear. This night battle with police lights and flames forced out a long-ignored question: in a national structure that cannot be negotiated, violence is always the first to cross the line.

Immigrants: Who are we?

If ICE's actions are an institutional law enforcement, then the protests that followed are more like an emotional street declaration. It came quickly and chaotically, but it was full of symbolic power: masked young protesters, holding high the Mexican flag, burning debris, and waving "Kill ICE" signs when blocking the 101 Freeway. These scenes are not just immigrant rights marches, but a deep expression of "identity".

The most controversial picture is the masked man holding high the Mexican flag, standing in front of the confrontation line of the National Guard. He became the "perfect demonstration object" in the conservative media's mouth-an "non-my race" who does not wear an American logo, refuses to reveal his identity, and opposes federal authority. But what he expressed was really political rebellion, or another cry for survival under extreme marginalization?

Los Angeles is one of the cities with the largest Latino population in the United States. According to city government data in 2023, more than 48% of the city's population is Latino, of which about one-third are undocumented or "semi-legal". Although many people do not have green cards, they have lived in the city for more than a decade, have families, work, and have children educated in public schools. In terms of "life facts", they are part of American society; in terms of "legal status", they are always "undetermined" waiting to be liquidated.
